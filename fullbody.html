    <h1>Full Body Workout</h1>
    <p>A full-body workout is a training session that targets all major 
    muscle groups in one workout, as opposed to splitting them into 
    different days like an "upper body day" or "leg day". This approach 
    uses compound exercises like squats, deadlifts, and push-ups to work
    multiple areas at once, making it an efficient way to build strength,
    endurance, and balanced muscle development. It's suitable for both 
    beginners and experienced athletes and often requires fewer sessions
     per week, typically three with rest days in between. </p>
