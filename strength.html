    <h1>Strength Training</h1>
    <p>Strength training is a type of exercise that involves working 
    your muscles against resistance to build strength, size, and
    endurance. This resistance can come from various sources, 
    including your own body weight, free weights, resistance bands, 
    or weight machines. It is also known as resistance training or 
    weight training.
